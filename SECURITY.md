# Security Policy

## Credentials

This extension handles your filelist.io username and passkey. These are stored locally in `chrome.storage.local` and are never transmitted to any server other than `filelist.io`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/dustfeather/filelist-ext/security/advisories/new) rather than opening a public issue.

You can expect an initial response within 48 hours.
